# Continuum_Mechanics-PMMA-StressStrain-Predictive-Model
Done by Gurpal Singh 05/01/2018 Boise State University

This project involved obtaining experimental data from academic sources and fitting a predictive model to the data. 
The model predicts deformation (strain) given measured stress/strain data.
The model is nonlinear and a r^2 metric was used to find a 'good fit.'
The project was completed in Matlab and the file descriptions are given below:

- Maxwell.m ->
- Model_Comparison.m ->
- LinearElasticIso.m ->
- Sensitivity_Study.m ->
- Model_vs_Exp.m ->
- Voight.m ->
- Mooney_Rivlen.m ->

A pdf report of the project is included for anyone that is interested!
